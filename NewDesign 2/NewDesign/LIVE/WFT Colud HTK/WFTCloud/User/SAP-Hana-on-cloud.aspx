            <h6><em>Smarter ‘SAP HANA on the Cloud’ operations with WFT Cloud:</em></h6>
              <h2>With a revolutionary SAP HANA in the Cloud solution, WFT Cloud ensures that Cloud HANA becomes more affordable to SAP customers:</h2>
              <p>With a revolutionary ‘Pay as You Go” SAP HANA on the Cloud solution, WFT Cloud now ensures that the historically expensive SAP HANA infrastructure, is now far more affordable to SAP customers. Despite its amazing prowess as a database model that can store and analyze very large volumes of data, SAP HANA experienced below average adoption levels, simply because of the hardware and licensing costs were prohibitively expensive. This is more so in today’s increasingly complex and competitive economic environment, as enterprises are fighting to reduce costs and remain competitive. So the only deterrent for adopting and benefiting from SAP HANA was the huge investments involved, in terms of SAP HANA infrastructure.</p>
              <h2>‘SAP HANA on the Cloud’ – A ‘Smarter SAP’ Solution from WFT Cloud:</h2>
              <p>By offering SAP HANA on the Cloud, WFT has ensured that SAP HANA customers can totally avoid making huge investments in SAP HANA hardware and licenses. By utilizing WFT Cloud’s SAP HANA in the Cloud solution customers can get Cloud HANA capabilities at just a few dollars per hour, thanks to WFT Cloud’s revolutionary ‘Pay as You Go” SAP HANA on the Cloud solution.</p>
              <h2>‘SAP HANA on the Cloud’ – An Overview:</h2>
              <p>Generally the term HANA refers to High Performance Analytic Appliance. HANA is a database model which is made to work in the memory termed as in-memory database. SAP has introduced HANA to store data and also more importantly analyze extraordinarily huge volumes of transactional data which are non-aggregated and to perform this analysis in Real Time. This finds its use in high performance analysis which is very useful for predictive analysis and real time decision making for an enterprise.</p>
              <p><strong>HANA's architecture has multiple components that can be classified as follows:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Management Services</li>
                  <li>Database Engine</li>
                  <li>In Memory Storage Engine</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Apart from this there is a also a classification for a persistence layer which relates to storage.</p>
              <p><strong>Under the management services, a set of services are provisioned that can</strong></p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Maintain and manage the connection and session management</li>
                  <li>A system to manage the transaction components maintaining the fundamental ACID rules.</li>
                  <li>An authorization system for handling security mechanisms</li>
                  <li>A System to manage metadata.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>The Database engine component is a collection of three major engines that perform the actual operations for analytics and performance, they are …</strong></p>
              <ol>
                  <li>The calculation engine</li>
                  <li>The Execution engine and</li>
                  <li>The Optimization engine</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The In -Memory Storage engine also has multiple components, which are primarily used for (1) Relational (2) Graphing and (3) Managing text and unstructured data</p>
              <p>The in Memory engine is essentially the next generation structure, that utilizes data structures and algorithms which can execute in the Cache memory. This is ideal for Real time OLTP and OLAP in a single unit / system.</p>
              <h2>‘SAP HANA on the Cloud’ – The Way Forward:</h2>
              <p>“Business operations can be streamlined through SAP HANA – SAP’s powerful in-memory, real time platform – for SAP Analytics. WFT Cloud had successfully executed SAP HANA proof of concepts. Based on these results, it is certain that users will gain massive advantages in terms of data storage and database access times – on a SAP landscape”, says CEO Ganesh Radhakrishnan.</p>
              <p><strong>WFT Cloud also brings in expertise in SAP Data Protection on Cloud. Recognizing the importance of SAP data protection, CTO Mahesh Reddy cited that WFT Cloud further provides multiple SAP Data Protection options to meet customers’ business needs:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>SAP Backup in Cloud for Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and traditional SAP database backup</li>
                  <li>SAP High Availability in Cloud for Private and Hybrid Cloud</li>
                  <li>SAP Disaster Recovery in Cloud (On-Premise to Hybrid or VPC Cloud)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>WFT Cloud enables SAP HANA on the Cloud customers enjoy significant cost savings by moving their Non-Production database to SAP HANA in the Cloud. Many of WFT Cloud’s customers have described plans to leverage WFT Cloud for its Cloud HANA solutions to reduce hardware costs and increase flexibility.</p>--%>
