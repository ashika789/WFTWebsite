                            <p>While we speak on OS/ DB Migration, WFT is committed to ensuring that post migration, your SAP System continues to be a stable product with high availability, security and sufficient performance for everyday business. WFT have certified and experienced consultant dedicated for OS/DB migrations, who has obtained the specialist qualification for the performance of database and operating system migrations. </p>

                            <li><strong>Migration Planning and Preparation</strong>
                            <p>The Preparation phase in the migration process is to take detail action on all aspects of migration planning. We assess that all of the necessary technical prerequisites including Hardware, Operating system, Database and SAP software. We provide you with resource planning, budgeting, project plan and time frame to ensure successful completion.

                            <li><strong>"Proof of Concept" (PoC) System Migration </strong>
                            <p>This phase starts with migration of the "proof of concept" test system. The PoC migration process involves performing a test migration of the production environment to the target platform and applying all fixes required to prepare for migration of the other systems in the landscape. It is during this phase of the project that the key business processes and interfaces are tested to ensure operability and that the functionality works correctly. If there are fixes required due to OS/database platform changes, they are implemented and tested during this phase of the project. </p>
                            <p>If there are other non-SAP components like Job Scheduling, EDI, Tax software (Vertax/Taxware/BSI), Output Management, Faxing and Monitoring/Capacity tools requiring migration as well, these need to be carefully researched and planned during the migration. WFT have deep understanding of SAP bolt- on systems and their migration along with SAP OS/DB migrations. </p></li>

                            <p>After the "proof of concept" test system is migrated and the technical functionality of the system has been proven, all systems in the landscape will be migrated. Throughout the process of migrating additional systems, the processes are refined to streamline and ensure success during the cutover of the production system.Before we proceed to the Go-Live phase, we make sure we provide complete documentation on process and procedure for the migration and we receive full customer approval. </p>
                            <h6>Final Migration and Go-Live: </h6>
                            <p>In this phase the migration of the production database and all dynamic data of SAP Production systems, interfaces and add-on systems are carried out. All changes and fixes are applied based on previous migration cycles. The functional team checks the system to ensure it is operating correctly. Once agreement that the system is operational the system is released to users Post Go-Live Support WFT team will assist customer with post-go live tuning. After going live with target production system, we schedule post go-live migration check with SAP support and assist with implementing recommendations from SAP support. </p>
