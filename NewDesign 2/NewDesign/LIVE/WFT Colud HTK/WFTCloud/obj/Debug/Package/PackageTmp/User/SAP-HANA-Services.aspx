                                <h4>SAP HANA Services</h4>
                                <p>SAP HANA is a transformative platform for real-time business, helping address some of the most complex and critical business challenges that organizations face today. It transforms business by streamlining transactions, analytics, planning, predictive and sentiment data processing on a single, in-memory database so that business can operate in real time. </p>
                                <p>The WFT assessment service for SAP HANA will be delivered via a combination of on-site and off-site components. Using the right adoption strategy for this new technology when integrating it into an existing environment can help customers obtain further benefits. </p>
                                <p>Specific to business, collaborative discussions of as-is and to-be states for information management will be discussed along with the business drivers and road map. From a technical perspective, the topics covered during the workshop include introduction, architecture, sizing, infrastructure requirements, migration strategy, backup recovery, high availability, data loads, post migration testing, current data model readiness related to the SAP NetWeaver® Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver BW), licensing, SLA’s and deployment model (i.e., on-premise or cloud).</p>
                                <p>If SAP HANA is deemed to be a viable option after the analysis, the next steps include review and analysis of the existing implementation of SAP NetWeaver BW and presentation of the planning steps required for a migration to SAP HANA. Evaluation of current data volumes and possibilities for optimization are also explored. WFT Cloud follows certified migration methodology for migrating from SAP NetWeaver BW to SAP HANA.</p>
                                <p>One of the earliest customers for this service is Canada's largest publicly traded power generator and marketer of electricity and renewable energy. The customer decided to explore the viability of implementing SAP HANA in its environment and making it the common data repository for big data analysis and the benefits it would bring to its business. WFT Cloud conducted the assessment workshop and delivered a report based on the findings, along with proposed next steps and the plan for migration . </p>
