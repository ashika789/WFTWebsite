        </p>

        <h4>Fees</h4>
        <p>
          WFT Cloud will charge you the fees stated in your Order. When launching a WFT Cloud Server, your credit card will be charged the full monthly subscription, for the price of the SAP Landscape Server that was selected. WFT Cloud Servers are charged in monthly billing increments. WFT Cloud uses a fixed-cost pricing model – in other words, your invoiced amount will be charged in its entirety at the beginning of your monthly billing cycle. If you choose a month-to-month contract, you will be charged based on your initial invoice and no discounts will be applicable to such accounts. Discounts are offered for multi-month subscription for dedicated servers. If you choose this option, you are bound to stay for the entire contracted period to avail the discounted price. Should you choose to cancel your service prior to the end of your discounted term, the remaining balance of the total amount will be billed and service will continue to be active for the remainder of the contracted period. WFT Cloud does not offer pro-rated billing services or pay-as-you-go option currently for the Express Cloud services. Unless you have made other arrangements, WFT will charge your credit card with invoice amount as follows: (i) for recurring fees, in advance, on or around the first day of each billing cycle, and (ii) for non-recurring fees (such as fees for initial set-up, overages, compute cycle fees, and domain name registration) on or around the date incurred, or on or around the first day of the billing cycle that follows the date incurred. Unless otherwise agreed in the Order, your billing cycle will be pre-paid monthly, beginning on the date that WFT Cloud first makes the services available to you. In some cases WFT Cloud will present an "Estimated Monthly Charge". The "Estimated Monthly Charge" is provided as a courtesy to you to help budget your monthly expenses. However, the Estimated Monthly Charge is a rough estimation of your charges based on your current usage and will not be your guaranteed monthly charge. Many items can change your monthly charge, including, but not limited to, backups, firewalls, bandwidth usage, support, domain names, private networking and any other optional WFTCloud service which you choose to enable. WFT Cloud may suspend all services (including services provided pursuant to any unrelated Order or other agreement we may have with you) if our charges to your credit card are rejected for any reason. WFT may charge interest on overdue amounts at 1.5% per month (or the maximum legal rate if it is less than 1.5%). If any amount is overdue by more than thirty (30) days, and WFT brings a legal action to collect, or engages a collection agency, you must also pay WFT's reasonable costs of collection, including attorney fees and court costs. All fees are stated and will be charged in US Dollars. Any "credit" that we may owe you, such as a credit for failure to meet a service level guaranty, will be applied to fees due from you for services, and will not be paid to you as a refund. Charges that are not disputed within sixty (60) days of the date charged are conclusively deemed accurate. You must provide WFT with accurate factual information to help WFT determine if any tax is due with respect to the provision of the Services, and if WFT is required by law to collect taxes on the provision of the Services, you must pay WFT the amount of the tax that is due or provide satisfactory evidence of your exemption from the tax. You authorize WFT to obtain a credit report at any time during the term of the Agreement. Any credit that we may owe you, such as a credit for a SLA remedy, will be applied to unpaid fees for services or refunded to you, at our discretion.
        </p>

        <h4>Cancellation & Refunds</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>By beginning your subscription, you authorize WFT Cloud to charge you a monthly fee at the designated rate.</li>

          <li>Your can manage your subscription through WFT Cloud website by logging to your account. Your subscription will remain active unless you choose to terminate your service. Any email requests or other forms of communication for cancellation will neither be honoured nor acknowledged as an acceptance of cancellation.</li>

          <li>Your account will be charged on the day the order is processed and the next payment will deducted in 30days from the first order is processed</li>

          <li>WFT Cloud will not be held responsible for the cancellation of the services managed by customers.</li>

          <li>WFT Cloud will not provide any refund if the customer fails to cancel their services through the WFT Cloud website before the next billing cycle.</li>

          <li>There are no refunds for partial used periods. Following any cancellation; however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current period.</li>

          <li>WFT has the rights to suspend your account any time incase of payment failure for the subscription</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Account Setup, Termination, and Billing</h4>
        <p>The account will be charged on the day the order is processed, regardless of the account billing date. The account will not be charged again until the next month's billing cycle.</p>

        <h4>Promotional Use</h4>
        <p>WFT or WFTCloud may refer to You, Your company, or your logo's for promotional purposes. Your company name, logos and the services that were provided to WFT may be used in promotional materials, advertising, marketing releases, newsletter, public disclosures and on the WFT website. This reference will be strictly limited to disclosure that WFT has provided services to the company and will not contain any confidential, sensitive or proprietary information in such a reference. The reference will also not provide any personally identifiable information about the individual or technical information regarding the landscape and design used by the customer at WFTCloud. However, WFT may disclose any information requested by law enforcement or when compelled by court order, applicable laws or regulations.</p>
        <p>Any work or professional services performed or provided by WFT under this Agreement shall not be deemed .Work For Hire,. but WFT shall grant a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to You, for the duration of this Agreement, its employees, affiliates, and third parties commissioned by WFT.</p>

        <h4>Microsoft Software License Policy.</h4>
        <p>Microsoft, as well as WFT company policy, does not allow mixing of Microsoft license ownership. For an example, a customer cannot use a WFT purchased Windows Server license in conjunction with their own customer license of MSSQL or any other Microsoft Product. This is a violation of Microsoft's licensing policies. The customer would have to obtain all Microsoft licenses through WFT and this cost is factored in the Windows Server Purchase. In some instances, we can allow the customer to supply all Microsoft licensed products, including the OS. However, all licenses must be provided by the customer and may not be mixed with WFT licensed Microsoft products. Any questions regarding this policy can be addressed to support@wftcloud.com</p>

        <h4>Limitation of Damages</h4>
        <p>Recovery of damages from WFT may not exceed the amount of fees it has collected on the account.</p>

        <h4>General</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Terms Of Service are subject to change without any prior notification.</li>
          <li>These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between the subscriber and WFT, Inc.</li>
